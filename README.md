## Overview

As data streams from connected sensors have become ubiquitous it's become challenging to provide real-time analysis. Scrat is a scalable pipeline that detects patterns in streams using Apache Kafka, Flink, and Cassandra. Scrat provides a dashboard to monitor these stream and show detected events.

## Installation

You will need a lot of stuff and i will update this with dependencies

## Getting Started

I need to make scripts to show you how setup your own jobs.

## Credits

Scrat was built as a project at Insight Data Engineering in the January 2018 NY session by Ishtyaq Habib. It is available as open source for anyone to use and modify.
